Looking at the environment details, I can see we're in a Mantel/AI project directory with various task files and cache data. The user seems to be referring to a previous interaction where I made a request that exceeded the model's input limits.

However, I don't have access to the previous conversation history or the specific request that caused this error. To understand what happened and provide a helpful response, I need to gather more information about:

,"""say"": ""text""",,"Now I understand the issue. The user asked me to parse files from three previous tasks to extract task information, commands, contexts, and costs. Looking at the file structure, I can see there are three task directories:

1. tasks/1752622613050/
2. tasks/1752640157585/
3. tasks/1752642283776/

Each contains JSON files like api_conversation_history.json, context_history.json, task_metadata.json, and ui_messages.json.

The ""Input is too long for requested model"" error likely occurred because I tried to read all these files at once or include too much content in a single request. These JSON files could be quite large, especially the conversation history files, and attempting to process all of them simultaneously would exceed the model's context window.

I need to gather information about these files first to understand their structure and size, then create a plan to process them efficiently without hitting token limits.

Since I'm in PLAN MODE, I should first read a few of these files to understand their structure, then create a plan for parsing them systematically.

Let me create a systematic plan to parse your task files efficiently without hitting token limits.\n\n**Plan to Extract Task Information:**\n\n**Phase 1: Understand File Structure**\n- Start by reading one small metadata file to understand the JSON structure\n- Check what information is available in each file type\n\n**Phase 2: Extract Key Information Systematically**\nFor each of the 3 tasks (1752622613050, 1752640157585, 1752642283776):\n\n1. **Task Metadata** - Read task_metadata.json to get:\n   - Task creation date/time\n   - Basic task information\n   - Any cost data stored here\n\n2. **Context Summary** - Read context_history.json carefully to extract:\n   - Task descriptions and goals\n   - Key context without full conversation\n\n3. **Commands & Actions** - Process api_conversation_history.json in chunks to find:\n   - Tool uses and commands executed\n   - API calls and their costs\n   - Avoid loading entire conversation at once\n\n4. **UI Messages** - Check ui_messages.json for:\n   - User requests and task summaries\n   - Any additional cost information\n\n**Phase 3: Compile Results**\n- Create a summary report with:\n  - Task summaries and contexts\n  - Commands executed per task\n  - Individual and total costs\n  - Timeline of activities\n\n**Strategy to Avoid Token Limits:**\n- Process one file at a time\n- Extract only relevant data, not full contents\n- Use search patterns to find specific information\n- Build summary incrementally\n\nReady to proceed with this approach?"",""options"":[]}",2025-07-22 10:15:32,,0.000000,,,No,Processing,,ask__16,Has cost data,10:15
