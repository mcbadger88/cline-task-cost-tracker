To provide a comprehensive answer about how to use checkpoints, I should:
1. First examine the checkpoints directory structure to understand what's there
2. Look at any checkpoint files to understand the format and content
3. Check if there are any configuration files that might explain the checkpoint system
4. Provide guidance on how to use checkpoints based on what I find

Let me start by exploring the checkpoints directory structure.
