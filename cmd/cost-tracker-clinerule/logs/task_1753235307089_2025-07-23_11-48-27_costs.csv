,"""say"": ""completion_result""",,"I have successfully enhanced the cost tracker with the following improvements:

## Enhanced Cost Tracking Features Added:

### 1. **New Columns Added:**
- **User_Context**: Shows what the user actually typed that triggered each request
- **Cline_Action**: Shows what Cline actually did (not just text responses)
- **Request_Tokens**: Input tokens for each request
- **Response_Tokens**: Output tokens for each request
- **Context_Size**: Total context window size used

### 2. **Better Search Terms:**
- Instead of generic terms like ""environment_details"", now creates meaningful search terms like:
  - `read_file_cost_parser` (when reading cost_parser.go)
  - `write_to_file_enhanced_main` (when creating enhanced_main.go)
  - `execute_command_mkdir_tools` (when creating directories)

### 3. **Image/File Detection:**
- Automatically marks requests that contain images with `[📷 2 images]`
- Marks file uploads with `[📁 1 files]`

### 4. **Action Classification:**
- **Cline_Action** column shows specific actions like:
  - ""Action: Update parser file""
  - ""Action: Inspect file structure""
  - ""Tool: Edit existing file""
  - ""Command: mkdir -p tools""

### 5. **Enhanced CSV Structure:**
```csv
Request_ID,Phase,Action_Description,Request_Tokens,Response_Tokens,Context_Size,Context_Percentage,Search_Term_In_Transcript,User_Context,Cline_Action,Request_cost,Total_Cost,Timestamp
REQ_001,Development,replace_in_file operation,1200,300,58000,32%,replace_in_file_cost_parser,and maybe you can add a column that describes what you did too,Action: Update parser file,0.018189,0.018189,2025-07-23 11:22:33
```

### 6. **Separate Tool Structure:**
- Created `tools/cost-parser/main.go` as standalone executable
- Avoids Go compilation conflicts
- Can be imported separately as needed

The enhanced cost tracker now provides much more meaningful and searchable data about what Cline actually does for each request, making it easier to analyze AI assistant behavior and costs.HAS_CHANGES",2025-07-23 12:08:13,,0.000000,,,Yes,Processing,32%,say_completion_result_78,Has cost data,12:08

**Copy and paste this exact message to the new task:**

```
Please check the enhanced cost tracking system I've been working on. The main example file is:

logs/enhanced_costs_demo.csv

This file shows the enhanced cost tracker running on task 1753233753310 with 63 cost entries and new columns including:
- User_Context (what the user actually typed)
- Cline_Response (what Cline actually did)
- Context_Tokens_Used and Context_Percentage
- Enhanced search terms and action descriptions

The enhanced cost parser executable is: enhanced_cost_parser
The source code is in: tools/cost-parser/main.go

Total cost for the demo task was $0.138193.

Please review the logs/enhanced_costs_demo.csv file to see the enhanced tracking in action.
```

The key files created are:
- **logs/enhanced_costs_demo.csv** - Main example with 63 real cost entries from current task
- **enhanced_cost_parser** - Compiled executable 
- **tools/cost-parser/main.go** - Enhanced parser source code
- **example_enhanced_costs.csv** - Hand-crafted example format

The enhanced tracker now captures what users actually type and what Cline actually does, plus token usage details.HAS_CHANGES",2025-07-23 12:11:08,,0.138193,,,No,Processing,,say_completion_result_115,Has cost data,12:11
