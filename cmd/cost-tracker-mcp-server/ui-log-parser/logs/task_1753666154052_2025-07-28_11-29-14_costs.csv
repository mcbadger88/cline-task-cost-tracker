Since this is a new project and the current directory is empty, I need to:
1. First understand the project structure and plan the architecture
2. Create the necessary Go files for the backend
3. Create HTML/CSS/JS files for the web UI
4. Implement the core functionality
5. Suggest additional features

Let me start by exploring the current directory structure to confirm it's empty, then begin creating the project structure.
