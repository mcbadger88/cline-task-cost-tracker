1. Add habits with weekly frequency

3. Web UI
4. Suggest additional features

Since this is a new project and the current directory is empty, I need to:
1. Set up the project structure
2. Create the Go backend with habit management functionality
3. Create a web UI (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
4. Implement the core features
5. Suggest additional features

Let me start by exploring the current directory structure to confirm it's empty, then begin creating the project.

I'll create a comprehensive habit tracking app in Golang with a web UI. Let me start by examining the current directory and then building the application step by step.",2025-07-28 11:52:32,,0.044296,"The user wants me to create a habit tracking app in Golang with a web UI. The requirements are:
